Github repository associated with the manuscript "Assessing Melting and Solid-Solid Transition Properties of Choline Chloride via Molecular Dynamics Simulations".

The repository is organized as:

--> LAMMPS Modification: contains a customized version of the LAMMPS "dihedral_style charmm" command, which was applied to couple and decouple Lennard-Jones interactions within the CHARMM force field.
--> Unit Cell: atomic positions of the unit cell of ChCl form \beta.
