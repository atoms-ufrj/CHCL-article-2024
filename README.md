Github repository associated with the manuscript "Assessing Melting and Solid-Solid Transition Properties of Choline Chloride via Molecular Dynamics Simulations".

The repository is organized into three main folders:

--> LAMMPS_Modification: contains a customized version of the LAMMPS "dihedral_style charmm" command, which was applied to couple and decouple Lennard-Jones interactions within the CHARMM force field.

--> Unit_Cell: contains the atomic positions of the unit cell of ChCl form \beta.

--> Melting_OPLS_DES_0.8: contains the calculations for each step of the PSCP method (relative free energy as a function of temperature; calculation of the parameters of the Gaussian potential; S->DWF, DWF->WF, WF->L).
